2003-02-28:

2002-11-04
- As has been discussed on the NG in mid-October, decoupled TJvCustomMonthCalendar from its appearance properties for the benefit of TJvDatePickerEdit which could now expose all the relevant appearance-related properties of its dropdown calendar while still retaining its create-on-demand model without having to manage duplicated data. At this stage the designtime interface of TJvMonthCalendar2 remains completely intact. In the future it might be considered to drop the individual appearance-related properties in favour of exposing the Appearance instance directly. //ogiesen

2002-11-02
- Added TStrings item editor to JvInspector //marcelb

2002-11-01

Also modified JvHook, JvButtons, JvCaptionButton, JvaCaptionButton, JvAppHotKey, JvDragDrop, JvEasterEgg, JvPlacemnt, JvMagnet, Jvgrdcpt to use JvWndProcHook instead if subclassing directly. Moved JvHooks to \Archive. Moved TJvWindowHook class from JvHook to JvWndProcHook and modified it to use the JvWndProc subclassing method.  //peter3, remkobonte

- Added JvScheduledEvents, ScheduleEditor. NOTE: needs JCL 1.22 or above // marcelb

2002-10-27

Affected units are JvEditor, JvHLPareser, JvRegAuto, JvRegAutoEditor, JvStrUtil, JvUtils, JvaScrollText and JvDBUtil // peter3
- Changed comment style of the first comment (license and author info) in JvHIDControllerClass, JvInspDB, JvInspXVCL, JvObjSel to make it easier to parse with the JVCL 3 admin tool //peter3

-- InspectorItem.SetEditCtrl()
   Reset Window Proc to old window proc before freeing the Old Edit Ctrl because I was getting a weird access violation when I tabbed too fast and tabbing was on. (Deepak Shenoy)
Note: have to consider reusing? Or somehow allowing custom call in at this point.
-- InspectorItem.DrawValue()
   Added the "If Data=nil" check at the beginning because sometimes we were getting data=nil (??)
